# g4-medical-linac
A geant4 model of a medical linac

# PhantomSD branch
- This branch features a Sensitive Detector for the phantom, energy deposited in an analysis H1, and drawing hits at the end of each event. I am taking the main branch a different direction, getting rid of the SD and just using steppingAction and runAction so I can accumulate all the events for the run.
